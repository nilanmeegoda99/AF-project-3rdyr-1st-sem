                    What is Lorem Ipsum?
                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry
                    . Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 150
                    0s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a t
                    ype specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
                    electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in th
                    e 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and
                    more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                    Why do we use it?
                    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable co
                    ntent of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it ha
                    s a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here
                    , content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing package
                    s and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search
                    for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various version
                    s have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).


                    Where does it come from?
                    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It h
                    as roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000
                    years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
                    looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passa
                    ge, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
                    undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibu
                    s Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in
                    45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the R
                    enaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

                    The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for tho
                    se interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicer
                    o are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

                    Where can I get some?
                    There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the ma
                    jority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words
                    which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum,
                    you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the L
                    orem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, makin
                    g this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin wor
                    ds, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which look
                    s reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected
                    humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

                    "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so b
                    eguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire,

                    . In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being a
                    ble to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in cer

                    therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasu
